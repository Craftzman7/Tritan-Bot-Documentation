# General Information

Tritan is a feature-rich Discord bot built with customization in mind. He comes packaged with a variety of commands and a multitude of settings that can be tailored to your specific needs. His codebase also serves as a base framework to easily create Discord bots of all kinds.

We are always working on adding more commands, so if you have a suggestion run `*support` and tell us!

## Tritan Infraction Setup:

Tritan is now able to issue and store infractions for your members, as well as logging them in your own ModLog channels! 

You need to setup all of the logging channels before the bot will work. Please also note that editing warnings must be done in the Logging Channels. 

I suggest making a `Tritan` channel and putting all logs in there. :\)

**Run `*infractionsetup` for more info!!!**
